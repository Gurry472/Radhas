                Offer with love and even plain water will taste sweet.
                Prepare a meal from heart and it becomes an offering worthy to
                serve Krsna. We believe everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa
                belongs to His beloved Srimati RadhaRani. We are a Kṛṣṇa
                conscious family in Stanmore, UK with our life and efforts
                dedicated to living a spiritually balanced life. With Radha’s,
                we offer a plethora of services:

                We are culinary and gourmet artists/professional chefs with over
                30 years of experience. We are passionate about creating
                traditional Indian, Sattvik, Ekadashi, spiritual (onion & garlic
                free), and fusion recipes. It is mentioned in religious texts,
                Puranas, that Srimati RadhaRani offers 108 Bhoga/meal
                preparations to Kṛṣṇa each day without repeating any single
                recipe for an eternity. Our attempt is to teach you to cook not
                just for yourself and your family’s palates but also for
                spiritual benefit. Inner satisfaction comes from pleasing others
                and who better to please and serve than Kṛṣṇa and then share it
                with your family. We invite you to join our cooking courses and
                enjoy an amazing experience to last a lifetime.
